Genitive Alternation
====================

Question: Does the RNN learn constructional preferencs in the genitive alternation having to do with definiteness, animacy, and possessor NP length?

Experiment: 2x2x2x2

* Construction is s-genitive or of-genitive
* Possessor is definite or indefinite
* Possessor is short or long
* Possessor is animate or inanimate (between items)

We expect the s-genitive to be favored when possessor is definite, short, and/or animate. These effects should manifest as interactions with construction type when predicting total surprisal.
