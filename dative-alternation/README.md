Dative Alternation
==================

Question: Does an RNN pick up on dative alternation biases related to verb meaning, NP length, and NP definiteness?

Experiment: 2x2x2x2x2

* Construction form: double object or PP object
* Theme long/short
* Theme definite/indefininte
* Recipient long/short
* Recipient definite/indefinite
* Verb has caused-motion meaning or not (across items)

When one of the theme or recipient is long and the other is short, we expect the short one to come first. When they differ in definiteness, we expect the definite one to come first. We expect caused-motion verbs to favor PP object form. These are all manifested as interactions with construction form.
